      <p>I am currently a Senior attending the University of Pittsburgh. I am
        majoring in computer science and planning to earn a minor in mathematics. I have many
        interests in the field of computing including cybersecurity, cryptography,
        game design and website design. My hobbies include playing guitar, hockey, soccer, and
        cooking. My favorite color is teal and a fun fact about me is that I can speak Japanese
        fluently. </p>

        I worked on this project in a team of four people. We worked to create
        a website to convert audio from a guitar to guitar tabliture. There where 
        many difficulties that we had to deal with in the creation of this project. 
        It was very difficult to figure out how to apply fast-fourier 
        tranformations on a website application to be able to decipher the audio
        information. Furthermore, how a guitar is setup made this a difficult task, as there
        are up to four different ways to play the same note. To overcome this we had to
        calcultate the most efficient possible note on the guitar from the previous note that
        was played.

      <p>
        I worked on this project by myself. I created a website that
        allows the user to choose a combination of fish and a tank size.
        The website then calculates any issues with the combination of
        fish that the user chooses or incompatibility with the size of the tank.
        This project gave me a good understanding of SQL, as I created a database
        to store all of my fish attributes. This also makes it easy to add fish later
        if needed. I also improved my JavaScript by having to do compatibility
        calculations of the fish that were selected.

        I worked on this project with two people. We created a simple restaurant game where
        you can independently control 3 characters. These characters can go to food stations to cook a
        requested dish. This project taught me the fundamentals of game design such as having a way to
        calculate the time in the game effectively and setting objectives and tasks. Other than game design
        fundamentals I also refreshed my experiences on Java with object-oriented programming by
        creating a player class to store each player's position and a unique avatar for each character.
        I also learned some basic Java graphical interfaces such as Graphics 2D and Jframe.

      <p>
          I worked on this project with one other person. We created a website that is accessible for
          Seniors. We did this by creating large pictures and large hitboxes to click on for activities
          geared toward seniors. We also added a text-to-speech feature as well for the activities. There
          were many difficulties with this project as we only had a 48-hour timespan to complete it for
          a competition. We quickly learned HTML and CSS basics to quickly put together a website.
