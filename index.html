            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>I am currently a Junior attending the University of Pittsburgh. I am
            currently majoring in computer science and planning to earn a minor in mathematics.
            I have many interests in the field of computing including cybersecurity, cryptography,
	    game design and website design. My hobbies include playing guitar, hockey, soccer, and 
	    cooking. My favorite color is teal and a fun fact about me is that I can speak Japanese 
	    fluently. </p>

            <h2>Senior Squad Project</h2>
            <div class = "box">
            <p> I worked on this project with one other person. We created a website that is accessible for 
            Seniors. We did this by creating large pictures and large hitboxes to click on for activities 
            geared toward seniors. We also added a text-to-speech feature as well for the activities. There 
            where many difficulties with this project as we only had a 48-hour timespan to complete it for 
            a competition. We quickly learned HTML and CSS basics to quickly put together a website.

            <div class = "box">
            I worked on this project with two people. We created a simple restaurant game where
            you can independently control 3 characters. These characters can go to food stations to cook a
            requested dish. This project taught me the fundamentals of game design such as having a way to 
            calculate the time in the game effectively and setting objectives and tasks. other than game design 
            fundamentals I also refreshed my experiences on Java with object-oriented programming by 
            creating a player class to store each player's position and a unique  avatar for each character. 
            I also learned some basic Java graphical interfaces such as Graphics 2D and Jframe.

            <h2>Fish Calulator</h2>
            <div class = "box">
              I worked on this project by myself. I created a website that  
              allows the user to choose a combination of fish and a tank size.  
              The website then calculates any issues with the combination of 
              fish that the user chooses or incompatibility with the size of the tank. 
              This project gave me a good understanding of SQL, as I created a database
              to store all of my fish attributes. This also makes it easy to add fish later  
              if needed. I also improved my javascript by having to do compatibility 
              calculations of the fish that were selected.
